    # --- Introduction to Blockchain ---
    ("What is blockchain?",
     "Blockchain is a decentralized, distributed ledger technology that records transactions across many computers, ensuring data immutability and transparency."),

    ("What are the key characteristics of blockchain?",
     "Decentralization, transparency, immutability, and consensus mechanisms are core features of blockchain technology."),

    ("What is a block in blockchain?",
     "A block contains a group of transactions, a timestamp, a nonce, and the previous block’s hash, forming a chain-like structure."),

     "A hash function takes input data and produces a fixed-size alphanumeric output. It ensures integrity and links blocks in a chain."),

    ("What is a genesis block?",
     "The genesis block is the first block in any blockchain and serves as the foundation for all subsequent blocks."),

    # --- Consensus Mechanisms ---
    ("What is a consensus mechanism?",

    ("What is Proof of Work (PoW)?",
     "PoW requires nodes to solve complex mathematical puzzles to validate transactions, ensuring security but requiring high energy consumption."),

    ("What is Proof of Stake (PoS)?",
     "PoS selects validators based on their stake (ownership of tokens), making the process more energy-efficient than PoW."),

    ("What is Byzantine Fault Tolerance?",
     "It refers to the blockchain’s ability to reach consensus even when some nodes act maliciously or fail to respond."),

    ("What is mining in blockchain?",
     "Mining is the process of validating and adding new transactions to the blockchain, typically using computational power (in PoW systems)."),

    # --- Cryptocurrency Basics ---
    ("What is cryptocurrency?",
     "A digital or virtual currency secured by cryptography and operating independently of central authorities, such as Bitcoin and Ethereum."),

    ("What is Bitcoin?",

     "Ethereum is a blockchain platform enabling smart contracts and decentralized applications (dApps), with Ether (ETH) as its native cryptocurrency."),

    ("What are altcoins?",
     "Altcoins refer to all cryptocurrencies other than Bitcoin, including Ethereum, Ripple, Litecoin, and thousands of others."),

    ("What is a crypto wallet?",
     "A wallet stores public and private keys and enables users to send, receive, and store cryptocurrencies."),

    # --- Smart Contracts ---
    ("What is a smart contract?",
     "A smart contract is a self-executing contract with the terms of the agreement written directly into code on the blockchain."),

    ("Which blockchain supports smart contracts?",
     "Ethereum is the most widely known blockchain supporting smart contracts. Others include Binance Smart Chain, Solana, and Cardano."),

    ("What language is used to write Ethereum smart contracts?",
     "Solidity is the primary programming language used for writing smart contracts on Ethereum."),

    ("Are smart contracts legally binding?",
     "Smart contracts may be legally binding, depending on jurisdiction, provided they meet the criteria of a valid contract under the law."),

    ("What are gas fees in Ethereum?",
     "Gas fees are payments made to compensate validators for the computational energy required to process and validate transactions on Ethereum."),

    # --- Use Cases and Applications ---
    ("What are real-world applications of blockchain?",
     "Applications include supply chain tracking, identity verification, healthcare records, voting systems, and financial transactions."),

    ("How is blockchain used in supply chain?",
     "It provides transparent, tamper-proof records of goods movement, ensuring authenticity and traceability."),

    ("What is DeFi?",
     "Decentralized Finance (DeFi) is a blockchain-based form of finance that doesn’t rely on traditional financial intermediaries."),

    ("What is an NFT?",
     "Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) are unique digital assets representing ownership of items like art, music, or virtual goods using blockchain."),

    ("How is blockchain used in voting?",
     "Blockchain ensures transparency, immutability, and auditability in electronic voting systems, reducing fraud risks."),

    # --- Risks and Challenges ---
    ("What are the main risks of cryptocurrencies?",
     "Risks include volatility, hacking, scams, regulatory uncertainty, and loss of private keys."),

    ("What is a rug pull?",
     "A rug pull is a scam in the crypto world where developers abandon a project and run away with investors’ funds."),

    ("What is a 51% attack?",
     "A 51% attack occurs when an entity gains control of the majority of the blockchain’s hashing power, enabling it to manipulate the ledger."),

    ("Can blockchain be hacked?",
     "While blockchain is highly secure, vulnerabilities can exist in smart contracts, wallets, or poorly managed exchanges."),

    ("What is a hard fork?",
     "A hard fork is a radical change to a blockchain protocol that makes previously invalid blocks/transactions valid (or vice versa), often resulting in two separate chains."),

    # --- Regulatory and Legal Aspects ---
    ("Is cryptocurrency legal?",
     "Legality varies by country. Some countries embrace it, while others ban or restrict its use and trading."),

    ("What is KYC in crypto?",
     "KYC (Know Your Customer) is a process where crypto exchanges verify users’ identities to comply with anti-money laundering regulations."),

    ("What is AML in crypto?",
     "Anti-Money Laundering (AML) laws are designed to detect and prevent illegal transactions through cryptocurrency platforms."),

    ("Are crypto transactions anonymous?",
     "Crypto transactions are pseudonymous—publicly visible on the blockchain, but not directly tied to personal identities unless linked."),

    ("What is CBDC?",
     "A Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) is a digital form of fiat money issued and regulated by a country’s central bank."),

    # --- Advanced Topics ---

     "Layer 2 solutions operate on top of the base blockchain to improve scalability, reduce transaction costs, and increase throughput (e.g., Lightning Network, Optimism)."),

    ("What is the Lightning Network?",
     "A Layer 2 protocol on Bitcoin that allows faster, lower-cost transactions via off-chain processing."),

    ("What is a DAO?",
     "A Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) is a governance body managed by smart contracts and token holders without centralized control."),

    ("What is staking in crypto?",
     "Staking involves holding funds in a cryptocurrency wallet to support network operations, such as block validation, in exchange for rewards."),

    ("What is a token vs a coin?",
     "Coins (e.g., BTC, ETH) operate on their own blockchains, while tokens (e.g., USDT, LINK) are built on existing blockchains like Ethereum."),

    # --- Investigation and Forensics ---
    ("How is blockchain used in investigations?",
     "Investigators analyze blockchain data (wallets, transactions) to trace illicit activities such as money laundering and ransomware payments."),
